# Parking-lot-detection-using-CV

For the End Semester Project of my elective course 'Robotics-1', I joined hands with my colleagues. We came up with a program that makes use of the two critical fundamental concepts in computer vision i.e., image transformations and perspective warping, and computer vision is one of the primary disciplines in robotics. 

We implemented an image stitching module that stitches images like we observe in the panorama camera feature in most smartphones. The stitched image is then fed into the main module that treats it by 

• Resizing
• Padding
• Binary masking
• Canny edge detection
• Contour detection
• Corner points detection 
• Perspective warping/transformation

The applications may include implementation in a document scanner, or as we implemented in the detection of a parking lot.
